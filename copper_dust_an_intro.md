Copper Dust: An Intro of Sorts
==============================

If you're looking to pick up the latest tools and services, this is not for you.

This is not a collection about technology, about progress. Yes yes I know it's in the title, but really it's not. If anything, it's about non-technology. But I'm jumping ahead and saying too much already.

Did you ever wonder why it's so difficult to keep up with modern inventions?

Did you ever get caught up in a fad?

Did you ever wonder what you'd do without something? Or what we did before something was invented? I mean, not just laugh at the idea, but truly wonder? 

Did you ever wonder why we have less time to enjoy ourselves even with all these gadgets that are here to improve our lives? 

Did you ever have something so /you/ that you wished you could use it forever and nothing else? 

If so, this is a collection for you.
