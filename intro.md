Empty Technology
================

"I'm a little teapot  
 short and stout  
 here's my handle  
 here's my spout."

Empty Technology is a lot of things, but more importantly, it's about NOT being a lot of things. It's not novelty. It's not frivolity. It's not status.

Empty Technology is about need, and about technology being there _just enough_ to let us get on with what we want to get on with. It is about tools to help us exist, not the other way around. It is about making a decision about how we want to live and what we want to do, then defining the technology to let us do it.

There is no "right" empty tech, because the tools we use must, necessarily, be guided by our decisions and priorities in other contexts. Our political, cultural, social desires are all more important than making money from the latest innovation. Innovation is not an output of technology, but technology can be a medium for progress. Empty Tech firmly believes that we are here to learn about ourselves, not about the things people want us to pick up.

This book is not a "how-to", like so many tech books. But it is about learning.
