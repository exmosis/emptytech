Empty Technology - A Manifesto
==============================

"I'm a little teapot  
 short and stout  
 here's my handle  
 here's my spout."

This collection is not intended to be a “howto”, like so many technical books. The “Technology” in the title is misleading. It is just a convenience, a way in, a starting point. Sometimes it’s easiest to start with what we’re most comfortable with, and work backwards, unpicking the knot until we reach what we’re _un_comfortable with. Start in the shallow end. Begin with what’s in front of you.

What’s in front of you is your hands. Doing stuff. Using things. Picking up books, and forks, and keyboards and razors, and steering wheels. And even teapots. Think of all of this as our toolkit - the extensions into the world that we build to make our hands better, to adapt them to the task we want to achieve. Our hands, our gateways to technology. And as time piles up, also our feet, our eyes, our tongues, our minds. 

Technology is all about convenience, and yet we spend so much of our time wishing we didn’t have to learn something new, or complaining about it once we _have_ learnt it. All the time, the only thing we really learn is that something new doesn’t live up to its promise of convenience. That there was a catch all along. That we had to pay more money to do everything we _really_ wanted to.
 
Empty Technology is a lot of things, but more importantly, it's about NOT being a lot of things. It's not novelty. It's not frivolity. It's not social status. It’s not certification. It’s not learning-for-learning’s sake, or for the good of the nation’s economy, or for getting grades in order to get a job. 

It’s not even a thing in itself.

Empty Technology is about need, and more specifically, about _appropriateness_. But how do we know what’s appropriate?

This is our starting point.

The “Empty Technology” name comes from the Chinese book, the _Tao Te Ching_. Ultimately, this is a book on both _creation_ and _ownership_ - or in techno-economic terms, about _adaptation_ and _power_. The idea of space as _potential_ is not only discussed as part of the text, but also serves to form the book itself - saying less, implying more, and allowing the reader to fill in the gaps. These gaps are what Empty Technology is concerned about.

“Windows and doors are cut to make a room.
The room’s use comes from emptiness.”

Use does not come from technology. Technology _allows_ itself to be used. The more a tool defines how it must be used, the less useful it becomes.

There is no "right" empty technology, because the tools we use must, necessarily, be informed by our own decisions and our priorities. Decisions based on technical bases tell us little about why we are here, or what we want to be. Priorities based on tools do nothing for the user.

Empty Technology strives to meet 2 aims:

1. Allow and encourage individuals to discover their own aims.
2. Allow users to achieve their aims with minimal unnecessary deviation.

Empty Technology therefore arises from an inherent tension - a tension between form and emptiness, between structure and non-structure, between doing stuff and getting out of the damn way. It is doomed as it is as subtle as the infinity of contexts it has to contend with. It is wondrous because it must keep to simplicity. 

The less you notice it, the stronger it is.
