Nomad Infrastructures: Scribe
=============================

It began when I realised how much I could carry around.

No, before that. It began when I started travelling by myself. Overnight train journeys. Short haul flights. Walking to work.

The tools available to us do everything that we need. And more. The challenge is not the techology, but whether the technology weighs us down. Technology can do too much, but we fall into the trap of seeing it as _value-for-money_. And so we believe we should hold on to it.

But all functionality, however virtual, requires a physical counterpart. Memory. Hard drives. Screens. Keys. All of it. We know this so much. We know it so much that we are willing to pay for a higher functionality-to-physicality ratio. To fit more ability into a smaller, lighter space.

Technical functionality is now outstripping our physical capacity to carry it though. We overload the functionality we think we want because we pay for it. And we carry more than we need for the same reason.

At the same time, we hold fast to the dependencies inherently designed into the technology. We pay more to carry more, and to demand more of our environment. How can this even make sense?

This is where it begins.

To return to basics: How can we maintain what we need, as simply as possible? Why do we seek complexity to provide what we don't need?

*Portability*

- Everything runs off USB these days. Maintain a common standard. Buy a USB battery.

- Look for sources of power which are low-/dependency/. Power outlets are often available for free, but not always. Solar power is becoming cheaper. 

- Balance commonality with /contingency/ - never rely on a single type or source of power. Be flexible.

- Can you carry what you need without noticing?

*Timeliness*

- Use can wait.

- Truly important things take time.

- The urgency that technology offers a solution to is merely a selling point, nothing more.

- Urgency requires planning. Non-urgency finds its own solutions.

*Feedback*

- Keep notes on what you're interested in, even if you don't know what they will change. Monitor what feels valuable - when you charge devices, how much communication gets wasted, signal to noise ratio, whatever takes your fancy. Write it down. With a pen. Keep doing it.

- Decide whether what you're measuring is more important than what you're doing. Why are you measuring it? 

- Don't rush: old habits die hard. New habits die harder. The only way to change them is by being relaxed.
