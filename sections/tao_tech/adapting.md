Adapting
========

Adopting technology - someone's else rules.

Adapting technology - what rules do you want?

When the tools are unclear, confusion follows.  
When the tools are understood, potential follows.

When the goals are unclear, exploitation and distraction.  
When the goals are known, remember them.

Know the goals you value. Commit to the technology you wish to understand.
