Flexibility
===========

Is use defined by the tool, or by the goal?  
If the tool changes, does it still meet your needs?  
If the goal changes, does it still require the tool?  

How much usage comes from habit?  
How much from expectation?  
Other people, other times.  

Uses meet.  
Tools flex.  
Know the limits.
