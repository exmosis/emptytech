silverdust

_Talking about her life and practice, she came close to tears. She was lonely. And her roof leaked. She said, "You can't live in the mountains if you're still attached, if you haven't seen through the red dust. Life in the mountains is hard. But once you've seen through the illusions of this world, hardships aren't important. The only thing that matters is practice. If you don't practice, you'll never get free of the dust of delusion.”_

Our boat pulls in at the town of Kom Ombo. Egyptian traders are lined up on either side of the street like caged prisoners - their stalls are their jail cells, adorned with textiles and sandals instead of posters and TVs. The cell bars are mostly invisible here though - there are simple white lines on the ground, serving as reminders and guides to traders and tourists alike, which prevent the walkway dissolving into chaos. Traders cannot cross the line. They seem to take it in turns to look either bored or predatory.
 
No such lines exist at the bus station, where arriving passengers are greeted by crowds of wannabe landlords clutching faded photos of the holiday flat they're letting out. Stepping down from the bus, each tourist is greeted by the cloud of dust and noise thrown up by the horde. It's hard enough to get off the bus and keep control of your bag, let alone stop to orient yourself and maybe find some shade. It's difficult to even see which way leads away from the crowd.

The unknown fascinations of dust, so ambient and so universal, trigger mixed responses. On one hand, dust is a remnant, something left behind after the main attraction. We talk of coming from dust and returning to dust, but only at funerals when becoming dust is foremost in our mind. We sweep dust away once the everyday activity of living has stopped. On the other hand, dust lingers with leftover power, and dormant echoes of its origin: Pixie dust, stardust, [EDust](http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/10-top-gadgets-from-iain-m-banks-culture-universe-1142782/2)… Dust is alive.
 
Taoists refer to red dust, hong-chen, to describe the “[material or secular world](http://www.aijcrnet.com/journals/Vol_1_No_3_November_2011/13.pdf)”. The stamping of 10,000 [bustling people](https://echowillow.livejournal.com/60487.html) throws up a cloud like the winds of a storm. Sometimes the [cloud is real]. Usually it's metaphorical, and all the more powerful to those who understand symbols.
 
Symbolism, like an air filter, is a way to keep the dust at bay, to separate it from the medium it floats in. The dust and symbols surround us, until we can no longer see the air.

Twitter stares at me. An endless flow of disjointed commentary, bitesized appeals for attention, avatar upon avatar clawing to the top of time. I flick windows. Emails remind me of special offers and what's happening on Twitter.
 
There is a cloud here, but it is not red like the earth. The thousands of miles of cable and the millions of tons of metals stir up something else: silver dust, as shiny and sparkly as the glamour of pixies. The dust glows like neon signs. The digital footprints of digital nomads kick it up, and it shimmers with remnants of communication and urgency.
 
We have yet to [develop the filters](http://www.wired.com/2015/06/twitter-project-lightning-timeline/) to see through the silver dust - like pixie dust, we are dealing with a form of magic that has intonations and intimations at its core. Not only that, but we're [slowly forgetting](http://qz.com/252456/what-it-feels-like-to-be-the-last-generation-to-remember-life-before-the-internet/) why we would ever need filters in the first place. The dust is everywhere.
 
There are [digital mountains](http://describe.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/the-deep-hills-of-net.html) out there, though. Life is hard there. But the air is clear.
